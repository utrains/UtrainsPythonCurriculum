Subtraction of 45 from 78
Multiplication of 7 and 6
Division of 144 by 12


2>What will be the output of the following expressions?"""

3>Write a program to calculate the area of a rectangle. The length and width should be taken as user input.
Formula: Area = length Ã— width

4>Calculate the Simple Interest using Python, given P = 5000, R = 5%, and T = 3 years.
Formula: SI = (P Ã— R Ã— T) / 100

5>Given a = 12 and b = 5, what will be the value of c in the following statements?
