"""Exercise Questions: Control Flow Statements in Python
1. Conditional Statements (if, if-else, if-elif-else)

1>Write a Python program to check if a number entered by the user is positive, negative, or zero.
2>Create a program that asks for a user's age and prints:
"Child" if age is less than 12
"Teenager" if age is between 12 and 18
"Adult" if age is above 18


3>Write a program to check whether a number is even or odd.
4>Write a Python program that checks if a number is divisible by both 3 and 5.
5>Create a Python program that takes input for a studentâ€™s marks and prints:
"Fail" if marks are below 40
"Pass" if marks are 40 to 60
"Good" if marks are 61 to 80
"Excellent" if marks are above 80




2. Looping Constructs (for, while)
6>Write a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.
7>Write a while loop to print numbers from 10 to 1.
8>Write a Python program to find the sum of the first 10 natural numbers using a for loop.
9>Create a program that prints all even numbers between 1 and 50 using a for loop.
10>Write a Python program to reverse a string using a for loop.

3. Loop Control Statements (break, continue, pass)

11>Write a program using a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 10, but stop at 6 using the break statement.
12>Write a program that prints all numbers from 1 to 10, but skips multiples of 3 using the continue statement.
13>Write a Python program using a while loop that keeps asking the user to enter a number until they enter a negative number.
14>Create a for loop that runs 5 times but uses the pass statement inside it.
15>Write a Python program that calculates the factorial of a number using a for loop.


Bonus Challenges ðŸš€
16>Write a Python program to check if a given number is prime or not using a for loop.
17>Create a program that prints the Fibonacci sequence up to 10 terms using a for loop.
18>Write a Python program to count the number of vowels in a given string.
19>Using nested loops, create a program to print a pyramid pattern of stars (*).
20>Write a Python program to generate a multiplication table for a number entered by the user."""
